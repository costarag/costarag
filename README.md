## 👨‍💻 About

15+ years building data-intensive, highly available platforms and teams across **sports**, **health**, and **telecom**. I've worked with multicultural teams across Brazil, Europe, and the US.

I stay close to product, hands-on where it counts, and use AI to reduce time to market and create faster feedback loops.

- Most recently led **70+ engineering and data people**
- Team handled **10x growth** in active users and orders per sport event
- Shipped faster by embedding AI into how we worked, kept systems stable through peak traffic
- Approach: grow strong leaders, give senior ICs real ownership, stay close enough to ask the right questions
